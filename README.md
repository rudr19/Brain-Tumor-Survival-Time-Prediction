# Brain Tumor Survival Time Prediction

This project focuses on predicting survival time for brain tumor patients using machine learning models. The goal is to help healthcare professionals make more accurate and personalized treatment decisions.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature extraction)
- Regression-based machine learning models
- Evaluation using key metrics (MAE, RMSE)


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rudr19/Brain-Tumor-Survival-Time-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
1. Load the dataset `BrainTumor.csv`.
2. Run the notebook `brain_tumor.ipynb` for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.


## Future Work
- Explore deep learning techniques for enhanced accuracy.
- Incorporate additional medical data for more detailed predictions.
